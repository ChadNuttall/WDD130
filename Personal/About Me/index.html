    <h2>Chad Nuttall</h2>
    <p>I amd studying Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>I am from Colorado. Games and Sports are my passion! I love to paint and rollerskate but not at the same time.</p>
    <p>Perhaps a surprising thing about me is that I don't play video games. In explaination growing up I spent most of my time, free or otherwise, outside. When I was an adult and tried to get into them as a means of spending time with friends I found I wasn't very interested.</p>
